# Flutter Calories Calculator APP - MobileAssignment3
Hello, Thank You, this is

An app was created for calculating calories based on 22 food items stored in a database. Each step of the application that was implemented is explained in this report. The food items are in a food item calorie pair. Where each food item has an associated calories amount. A database in a databasehelper file was created in order to store these food items. The user will select a target calories per day, and the food items they  select can not exceed the target calories they have selected. The dart files, needed to import the relevant classes aswell. The user will then be able to save this meal plan to the database after providing the date.
